 TODO:
  - Get GetLatestNonZeroValue to output the date as well so I can work out dates for historical relative values. Is that best way to do this?
  - Then sort inflation
  - Sort decimal plaecs in reserves (I think this is sorted but just check it).
  - Work out the graph date bug.
  - Add toggle for minimum wage and also FX.
  - Sort MinimumWage five year label.
